## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
  - The purpose of this analysis is to explain the findings of the model that was created to predict the credit risk of potential loan borrowers.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
  - The dataset consisted of past loan data including: the loan size, the loan interest rate, the borrower's income, the debt-to-income ratio, the number of       accounts, derogatory marks, the total debt, and the loan status for thousands of past loans.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
  - The model was created to predict 
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
