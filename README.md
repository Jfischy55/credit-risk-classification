## Credit Risk Analysis Report

* Purpose of the analysis.
  - The purpose of this analysis is to explain the findings of the model that was created to predict the credit risk of potential loan borrowers.
* Financial information the data was on, and what was needed to predict.
  - The dataset consisted of past loan data including: the loan size, the loan interest rate, the borrower's income, the debt-to-income ratio, the number of       accounts, derogatory marks, the total debt, and the loan status for thousands of past loans.
  - This data was used to train a model to predict the credit worthiness of potential borrowers, and measure their credit risk.
* Stages of the machine learning process as part of this analysis.
  - The dataset was divided into X and y. The data was then split into training and testing data. The model's accuracy was then checked and reported in this analysis.
* Methods Used:
  - The logistic regression model was used in order to create, train, test, and report the results of this model.

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * The balanced prediction accuracy was about 97%
    * The recall was 97%
    * The precision was 92%

## Summary

* I would recommend this model, it was able to predict credit worthiness with a 97% accuracy.
